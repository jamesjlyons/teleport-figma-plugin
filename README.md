# Teleport

### A simple Figma utility plugin

`Teleport to New Page` command creates a new page called "Teleported Here" and moves the current selection to that page.

`Clone and Teleport to New Page` command creates a new page called "Cloned Here" and sends a duplicate of the current selection to that page.
