# Teleport

### A simple Figma utility plugin

`Teleport to New Page` command creates a new page called "Teleported Here" and moves the current selection to that page.

`Clone and Teleport to New Page` command creates a new page called "Cloned Here" and sends a duplicate of the current selection to that page.

Extra helpful if [commands are mapped to custom keyboard shortcuts](https://hustle.bizongo.in/custom-shortcuts-for-figma-8c93f3bc9ca2) through the Figma desktop app on Mac.
Examples with no current shortcut conflicts:

- `⌘T` for `Teleport to New Page`
- `⌘⌃T` for `Clone and Teleport to New Page`.
